 SCQUEL.0001_DESC:0 "The [GetTitleByKey('k_lordaeron').GetName] lies in ruins, its proud towers reduced to rubble, its people either slaughtered or risen to serve in undeath. The sweet symphony of their screams still echoes in my ears, a prelude to the next movement of our grand opus. The time has come to bring the [GetTitleByKey('k_quelthalas').GetName] to its knees.\n\n"Commander," I call out, my voice resonating with dark authority. In my peripheral, I see the shambling corpse of a figure wearing the armour of Lordaeron, once a soldier or a captain, moving toward me. "Prepare our forces. We march to Silvermoon."\n\nOur goal is the [GetTitleByKey('c_sunwell_plateau').GetName], the font of unimaginable power that will cement our dominion. The High Elves, with their arrogance and their radiance, will know despair. Their light will be snuffed out, replaced by the eternal darkness we bring. I relish the thought of their golden spires crumbling, their forests burning, and their people bowing before the inevitable tide of death. The Sunwell shall be ours, and with it, the Scourge will be able to bring back the Necromancer from the dead. The High Elves believe themselves safe behind their ancient wards and powerful magics, but they will learn that no barrier can withstand the will of the [GetTrait('lich_king').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."

It is time to shatter the delusions of the Elves and their so perceived invincibility, and to drown their people in their blood. We march on the city for one, single task. The [GetTitleByKey('c_sunwell_plateau').GetName].\n\nWith the magical energies contained within the [GetTitleByKey('c_sunwell_plateau').GetName], The [GetTrait('lich_king').GetName(GetNullCharacter)] will return the Necromancer from the dead and provide me with an ally for the future battles to come.\n\nAn opportunity presents itself to offer fealty to those that serve the [GetTitleByKey('k_quelthalas').GetName], to betray their ruler and join the forces of the Scourge. \n\nAll must serve the [GetTrait('lich_king').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."

 SCQUEL.0007_DESC:0 ""My kingdom had always been a beacon of light and magic, a sanctuary for my people. Yet, the shadows of dread now loomed over our golden spires, their tendrils reaching ever closer.\n\n"My liege," my trusted advisor, an elf of great wisdom and age, approached with urgency, a scroll gripped tightly in his hands. "A message has arrived from our scouts at our southern borders."\n\nAs my advisor broke the seal and unfurled the scroll a palpable tension gripped the throne room. Nobles and sentinels alike leaned in with their faces etched with a mix of fear and anticipation.\n\nHis voice, usually steady, now wavered as he read. "The Scourge has march upon our borders. Silvermoon stands on the brink of destruction. Undead legions, led by the dark force that betrayed Lordaeron, now advance upon us. They come for the Sunwell, and they will not stop until all of Quel'Thalas is consumed in their unholy wrath."\n\nA chill ran through the hall, colder than any winter's breath. The magnitude of the threat was clear, and the weight of our people now rested upon my shoulders.""

 SCQUEL.0008_DESC:0 "My kingdom had known everlasting peace for many years under my reign, but the tranquility was fragile - like the thin ice of a frozen pond. The harbinger of that fragility now stood before me and his face ashen with fear.\n\n"Your Majesty," my steward, a loyal man who had served my family for decades, stepped forward with a letter clutched in his trembling hands. "A missive."\n\nThe seal was unmistakable, the symbol of Lordaeron, but it was smeared with a dark substance that looked suspiciously like blood. As the steward broke the seal and unrolled the parchment, the hall fell silent, the courtiers and guards alike straining to hear the news.\n\nHe read the words aloud, his voice quivering. "Lordaeron has fallen. The city lies in ruins, its people either slaughtered or risen as undead by the vile magic of the Scourge. A betrayer has led this abominable horde against their own homeland. Now, they march towards Quel'thalas, with vengeance and death in their wake.""
