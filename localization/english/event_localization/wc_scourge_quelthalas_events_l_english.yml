 SCQUEL.0001_TITLE:1 "The Fall of Lordaeron"
 SCQUEL.0001_DESC:1 "The news is grim and unrelenting.\n\nLordaeron, the great bastion of humanity, has fallen. The Scourge, relentless and merciless in their nature, have claimed the city.\n\nAs the courier's words echo through my chambers, a heavy silence descends.\n\nThis is not just the loss of a city; it is the shattering of hope, the unraveling of our defenses.\n\nThe Scourge's reach grows longer, their hunger insatiable. How could such a calamity befall us? How did we fail to foresee this doom?
\n\nIf Lordaeron, with all its strength and glory could not withstand this tide of darkness, what hope do we have? The people look to me for guidance, for protection, but can I truly offer them safety in these dark times?"
