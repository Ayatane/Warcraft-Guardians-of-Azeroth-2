 SCQUEL.0001_TITLE:1 "The Battle For Silvermoon"
 SCQUEL.0001_DESC:0 "My kingdom had known everlasting peace for many years under my reign, but the tranquility was fragile - like the thin ice of a frozen pond. The harbinger of that fragility now stood before me and his face ashen with fear.\n\n"Your Majesty," my steward, a loyal man who had served my family for decades, stepped forward with a letter clutched in his trembling hands. "A missive."\n\nThe seal was unmistakable, the symbol of Lordaeron, but it was smeared with a dark substance that looked suspiciously like blood. As the steward broke the seal and unrolled the parchment, the hall fell silent, the courtiers and guards alike straining to hear the news.\n\nHe read the words aloud, his voice quivering. "Lordaeron has fallen. The city lies in ruins, its people either slaughtered or risen as undead by the vile magic of the Scourge. A betrayer has led this abominable horde against their own homeland. Now, they march towards Quel'thalas, with vengeance and death in their wake.""
