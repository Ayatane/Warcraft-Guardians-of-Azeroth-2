Their warriors have massacred the innocent wherever they may be found, including the houses of [founder.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate].\n\nThe [abbot.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $c_northshire$ has pleaded with me to allow his clerics and their followers to take up weapons and train for war. To accept could set a dangerous precedent, and may lead to a future war with the Church.\n\nStill, I have no choice. The [invader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTooltip] bear down on us and threaten to eradicate my people. This new fighting force will be known as the [leader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseName]."

Their warriors have massacred the innocent wherever they may be found, including the houses of [founder.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate].\n\nI have beseeched the [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l] to allow my priests to join the fight, not just as healers, but as bearers of weaponry and spells of smiting. Without these, they will be cut down by the savage [invader.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTooltip], leading only to further death.\n\nKnowing this, the [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l] has wisely granted me this request, even allowing our flock to equip themselves for war. Still, should we win, $c_northshire$ will wield signifcantly more influence in the [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l]."

The [abbot.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $c_northshire$ has called upon them to take up arms and study the once-forbidden spells, the destructive magic of smiting.\n\nFollowing them are bands of fanatical pilgrims, peasants no longer content to aid the war through menial labor. Our [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l] shall now incorporate this new warband into our army."

Their wounds are healed by the clerics that lead them, and their weak forms are bolstered by holy blessings."

This new fighting force calls itself the Brotherhood of $c_northshire$, and represents a disturbing new norm for the [founder.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternatePossessive] faithful."
