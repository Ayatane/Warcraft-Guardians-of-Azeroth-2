 drust_crisis.1.desc:0 "With Drustvar completely under control of the agents of Thros, the hopes of the inhabitants of Kul Tiras grow dim. As the local populace of Drustvar continues to fall prey to the foul presence permeating the land, the corrupted elite has managed to gather enough power to summon their dark master to the material plane. The ominous island of Fate's End stirs as the ancient Drust king, Gorak Tul, has re-entered Azeroth. Now Gorak Tul sets his sights upon the humans and other races inhabiting Kul Tiras, which he regards as an outlander infestation upon the ancestral land of the Drust."

Knowing that worst had come to pass, they have no choice but to fight for their lives and their future."

 drust_crisis.5.t:0 "The Face in The Floor"
 #drust_crisis.5.desc:0 "Recently, the illness that has befallen [sick_spouse.GetFirstName] has been growing worse with each passing day. Knowing well that [sick_spouse.GetSheHe] might not last another week, you have sought many solutions, be it magical or alchemical, but nothing seems to help alleviate [sick_spouse.GetHerHis] condition. The grief over your inevitable loss overcomes you, and in desperation you cry out in hopes that something or someone will hear your pleas. To your surprise, a shadowy figure emerges and makes you a promise that death will never part you and your spouse... for a price. It offers you unimaginable power and eternal life in exchange for loyalty and you realise this might be the only way to keep your beloved at your side. Conflicting thoughts cross your mind, but you ultimately realise that if death can part you both..."
 drust_crisis.5.desc:0 "\"Rest well, my love.\"\n\n The candle burns out on another evening as [ROOT.Char.GetName]'s nightly vigil over [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] sicky spouse, [sick_spouse.GetFirstName] comes to a close. Eyes heavy with exhaustion and nascent tears, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] rises quietly from [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] chair, gingerly exits the guest bedroom, and rests [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] head against the ornate hallway wallpaper.\n\nIt has been months since [sick_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] first fell ill; and no magic, no potion, no remedy can cure [sick_spouse.GetHerHim]. In a rush of emotion and stress, the tears become a waterfall, cascading down [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] cheeks.\n\"Oh Gods," [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] sobs, \"Oh powers of this world and beyond, I beg of you. I plead of you! I would do anything to see [sick_spouse.GetHerHim] well!\"\n\n\"Would you serve?\"\n\n A voice comes from the floor where [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] tears stained the ancient floorboards. It is a soft voice at first, creaky like old stairs underfoot. [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] opens [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] eyes.\nThere in the floorboard right before the baseboard a face with glowing blue eyes framed by hornlike growths stares upwards, its square jaw locked in grim and assured authority. Something has made its way into this world, through a tiny window of wood— Something with an ancient power that [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] can sense intuitively.\n\n\"Would you serve?\" The tiny face asks again, its loudening voice laden with intent and expectaiton as it appears to swell and expand to take up [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] entire field of view \"WOULD YOU SERVE— #EMP ME#!?\""
 drust_crisis.5.a:0 "For [sick_spouse.GetHerHim]? I would. With all my heart."

 #drust_crisis.6.desc:0 "Your illness has been progressing in a steady pace and you've already been coming to terms that you might not survive. However, one day you notice [worried_spouse.GetFirstName] entering your chambers and immediately recognize that [worried_spouse.GetSheHe]'s unusually cheerful. Suddenly, you see a horrific spectre looming above. "Don't be startled, dear. I have found a solution for your illness. You no longer have to worry about leaving me alone here... We'll be together forever." You attempt to flee, but you notice that dark magic is binding you. You hear your spouse chanting something in an unrecognisable language and after a brief moment of darkness, you come back to your senses, although you notice that something has changed. You are dead, but at the same time you are not. As you struggle to understand your situation, you notice that your significant one also became afflicted."
 drust_crisis.6.desc:0 "A laden cough escapes [ROOT.Char.GetNamePossessive] lungs, waking [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] in the dark predawn hours and producing a choking wad of phlegm. A sudden, panicked, drowning feeling overcomes [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], and all that keeps it from overcoming [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] with suffocation is the continued fit of coughing. Whirling, confused by illness, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] mind immediately goes to [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] [worried_spouse.GetWifeHusband] [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstName], as if the thought might be [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] last.\n\nSuddenly, as if summoned, [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] calmly opens the door, a small bowl in [worried_spouse.GetHerHis] off-hand. She looks thoroughly exhausted, but overcome with a strange animating energy as [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] smiles.\n\"My love!\" the [worried_spouse.GetTitleTierName] says dotingly above [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] coughing as [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] places the bowl under [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] nose, \"Breathe in as deeply as you can.\"\nThe smell overcomes the coughing [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName], a smell like rotting pine and brimstone that makes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] arm hairs stand on end. Suddenly, [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] breath returns. But before he can speak, [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] shushes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim].\n\"All is well,\" [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] says, \"All #italic will#! be well. I have found someone to help us.\"\n\nOver [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] [worried_spouse.GetWifeHusband]'s shoulder, in the dark space where the door was left open, something appears to fade into view— A face, wooden and grainy with glowing blue eyes set deep beneath a pair of hornlike growths and above a grim, authoritative, glowering square jaw. The world seems to warp around the face, pulling it towards [ROOT.Char.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] field of view. It keeps growing. [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] can feel its othworldly power in the scent from the bowl that lingers in [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] nose. [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] closes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] overcome with a fearful resignation to this eldritch power."

 drust_crisis.7.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks, the ruling elite of the Drustvar region has gone dark; millitary communiques went unacknowledged and noble invitations went unanswered. The situation became critical days ago as food supplies to the rest of Kul Tiras petered out and have recently been replaced by scattered refugess bearing strange rumors and dark news. Abandoned wives and orphaned children report entire families disappearing from their homes, their fields, and roads which were once deemed safe. Frantic refugees describe shadowy covens lurking in the darkest recesses of Drustvar's forests, corrupting the land and replacing its populace with strange constructs of wood and bone. Many believe that these strange occurences are caused by an ancient curse which has befallen the ruling house of Drustvar. To counter whatever this new threat might be, an inquisition comprised of many battle-hardened champions from the Admiralty and beyond has been called to action."

Apparently, an unknown type of corruption has befallen the rulers of the westernmost region of Drustvar, with shadowy covens and constructs never seen before roaming the land. They managed to strike some kind of bargain with these creatures, and now the armies of vrykul-looking humanoids gather on the island of Fate's End, preparing to strike at the heart of the isle. We can only hope this threat can be contained, lest they set their sights beyond the isles."
