 drust_crisis.1.t:0 "The Summoning of Gorak Tul"
 drust_crisis.1.desc:0 "\"One last broken, severed limb; one last wrap of hidebound bark— and so, the wicker effigy is complete. Now to begin the ritual, to cast the spell to give it unlife and mold it into the Master's visage.\"\n\nAll around [ROOT.Char.GetName], a ring of hooded figures begins a chant older than the name of [[GetTitleByKey('k_kul_tiras').GetNameNoTier] and the air begins to charge with dark power. [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName] begins to chant, face obscured under [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] hood as [ROOT.Char.GetHeShe] takes a few steps back, slowly lifting [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] hands in adulation. The shadows of the ancient, undying trees that arc and crisscross the night sky begin to darken, as if they are absorbing the very blackness of night into themselves.\n\nSuddenly, there is a crack like a rotting trunk breaking beneath its own weight. The effigy itself begins to shift, shake, and fuse with itself. The mask over its head, the severed and skinned skull of a [GetTitleByKey('c_fallhaven').GetNameNoTier] dockworker, bends as if made of clay and melts into the flyblown tissue. Rarified darkness pours from the cursed trees into the wicker effigy and its form takes on the sculpted muscle and smooth skin of a Vrykul. As the chant reaches a crescendo, the former effigy steps forward. No longer a crude statue; it is a fusion of tree and Vrykul that is graceful, strong, and terrifying— a Drust. The face that [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName] saw long ago in Waycrest Manor is now given flesh and form, and it is magnificent. The chant ceases, the ritual complete, and the ancient being raises its head to speak.\n\n\"Gorak Tul stands before you. All who do not kneel shall fall.\""

 drust_crisis.5.t:0 "The Face in the Floor"
 drust_crisis.5.desc:0 "\"Rest well, my love.\"\n\n The candle burns out on another evening as [ROOT.Char.GetName]'s nightly vigil over [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] sicky spouse, [sick_spouse.GetFirstName] comes to a close. Eyes heavy with exhaustion and nascent tears, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] rises quietly from [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] chair, gingerly exits the guest bedroom, and rests [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] head against the ornate hallway wallpaper.\n\nIt has been months since [sick_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] first fell ill; and no magic, no potion, no remedy can cure [sick_spouse.GetHerHim]. In a rush of emotion and stress, the tears become a waterfall, cascading down [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] cheeks.\n\"Oh Gods," [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] sobs, \"oh powers of this world and beyond, I beg of you. I plead of you! I would do anything to see [sick_spouse.GetHerHim] well!\"\n\n\"Would you serve?\"\n\n A voice comes from the floor where [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] tears stained the ancient floorboards. It is a soft voice at first, creaky like old stairs underfoot. [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] opens [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] eyes.\nThere in the floorboard right before the baseboard a face with glowing blue eyes framed by hornlike growths stares upwards, its square jaw locked in grim and assured authority. Something has made its way into this world, through a tiny window of wood— Something with an ancient power that [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] can sense intuitively.\n\n\"Would you serve?\" The tiny face asks again, its loudening voice laden with intent and expectation as it appears to swell and expand to take up [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] entire field of view.\n \"WOULD YOU SERVE— #EMP ME#!?\""

 drust_crisis.6.t:0 "The Face Behind the Door"
 drust_crisis.6.desc:0 "A laden cough escapes [ROOT.Char.GetNamePossessive] lungs, waking [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] in the dark predawn hours and producing a choking wad of phlegm. A sudden, panicked, drowning feeling overcomes [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], and all that keeps it from overcoming [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] with suffocation is the continued fit of coughing. Whirling, confused by illness, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] mind immediately goes to [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] [worried_spouse.GetWifeHusband] [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstName], as if the thought might be [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] last.\n\nSuddenly, as if summoned, [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] calmly opens the door, a small bowl in [worried_spouse.GetHerHis] off-hand. She looks thoroughly exhausted but overcome with a strange animating energy as [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] smiles.\n\"My love!\" [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] says dotingly above [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] coughing as [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] places the bowl under [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] nose, \"breathe in as deeply as you can.\"\nThe smell overcomes the coughing [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], a smell like rotting pine and brimstone that makes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] arm hairs stand on end. Suddenly, [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] breath returns with a jold. Yet before he can speak, [worried_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] shushes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim].\n\"All is well,\" [worried_spouse.GetSheHe] says, \"All #italic will#! be well. I have found someone to help us.\"\n\nOver [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] [worried_spouse.GetWifeHusband]'s shoulder, in the dark space where the door was left open, something appears to fade into view— A face, wooden and grainy with glowing blue eyes set deep beneath a pair of hornlike growths and above a grim, authoritative, glowering square jaw. The world seems to warp around the face, pulling it towards [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] field of view. It keeps growing, and [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] can feel its othworldly power in the scent from the bowl that lingers in [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] nose. [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] closes [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] eyes, overcome with a fearful resignation to the eldritch power that now surges through him."

The situation became critical days ago as food supplies to the rest of [GetTitleByKey('k_kul_tiras').GetNameNoTier] petered out and have recently been replaced by scattered refugees bearing strange rumors and dark news. Abandoned wives and orphaned children report entire families disappearing from their homes, their fields, and roads which were once deemed safe. Frantic refugees describe shadowy covens lurking in the darkest recesses of [GetTitleByKey('d_drustvar').GetNameNoTier]'s forests, corrupting the land and replacing its populace with strange constructs of wood and bone. Many believe that these strange occurences are caused by an ancient curse which has befallen the ruling house of [GetTitleByKey('d_drustvar').GetNameNoTier]. To counter whatever this new threat might be, an inquisition comprised of many battle-hardened champions from [GetTitleByKey('k_kul_tiras').GetNameNoTier] and beyond has been called to action."
