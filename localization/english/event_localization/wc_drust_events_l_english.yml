As the local populace of Drustvar continues to fall prey to the foul presence permeating the land, the corrupted elite has managed to gather enough power to summon their dark master to the material plane. The ominous island of Fate's End stirs as the ancient drust king, Gorak Tul has re-entered Azeroth and now has set his sights upon the outlanders inhabiting Kul Tiras, which he regards as an infestation upon the ancestral land of the drust."

 drust_crisis.5.desc:0 "Recently, the illness that has befallen [target_sick_spouse.GetFirstName] has been growing worse with each passing day. Knowing well that [target_sick_spouse.GetSheHe] might not last another week, you have sought many solutions, be it magical or alchemical, but nothing seems to help alleviate [target_sick_spouse.GetHerHis] condition. The grief over your inevitable loss overcomes you, and in desperation you cry out in hopes that something or someone will hear your pleas. To your surprise, a shadowy figure emerges and makes you a promise that death will never part you and your spouse... for a price. It offers you unimaginable power and eternal life in exchange for loyalty and you realise this might be the only way to keep your beloved at your side.

Suddenly, you see a horrific spectre looming above. "Don't be startled, dear. I have found a solution for your illness. You no longer have to worry about leaving me alone here... We'll be together forever." You attempt to flee, but you notice that dark magic is binding you. You hear your spouse chanting something in an unrecognisable language and after a brief moment of darkness, you come back to your senses, although you notice that something has changed. You are dead, but at the same time you are not. As you struggle to understand your situation, you notice that your significant one also became afflicted."

 drust_crisis.7.desc:0 "Disturbing news have reached us from Drustvar. The ruling elite has gone dark and no one is entirely sure what is happening in the region. The food supplies to the rest of Kul Tiras were suddenly cut and people apparently started disappearing, while rumours abound of shadowy covens lurking in the darkest recesses of Drustvar's forests, corrupting the land and its populace. Many believe that the strange occurences are caused by an ancient curse which has befallen the ruling house of Drustvar. To counter whatever this new threat might be an inquisition comprised of many battle-hardened champions from the Admiralty and beyond has been called to action."
