wc_elemental_ritual_events.1001.desc:0 = "In my many tears of communion with the elements, I have heard whispers from the spirits and discerned ancient shamanic carvings regarding a feat of mastery that separates a simple tribal shaman from a truly legendary elementalist who has become one with the domain of Fire...\n\nWith the knowledge I have gathered over years of communion and research I have sketched the outline of a ritual that will transport me to the Elemental Plane of Fire itself. This ritual would be too dangerous for a journeyman ingnimancer, but I am sure that my strong bond with the fire spirits of Azeroth will protect me should I successfully reach the plane of Fire. The end result, an audience with the legendary Firelord, could grant me great power to protect my people and the elemental spirits of this world."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1002.desc:0 = "Enchanted braziers crackle in the dark, the scent of ash and brimstone fills the air. My assistant places hot embers at exact points on a sigil etched with charcoal onto the stone floor. My mind is focused as I pass the halfway mark of the complex incantation, my mind focused solely on my objective, reaching the Elemental plane of Fire.\n\nMonths of planning, preparation, and communion with the terrestrial elemental spirits of fire have led to this moment; the journey to the Elemental plane in the hopes of an audience with the Firelord himself. My mastery of elemental fire must be complete, or else I will spontaneously immolate upon arrival from the intense planar heat. This will not come to pass. I am ready."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1003.title:0 = "Planar Translocation- Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1003.desc:0 = "A surge of heat courses across my body, and for an instant I see my assistant thrown back as I am engulfed in flame. The fire elemental spirits that have gathered around me surge into the inferno and reach their tendrils into my body, touching my essence and making me one of them for a time. I feel their heat, their will, the feelings of frienship and trust we have cultivated on this spiritual journey together. It gathers to a crescendo and suddenly...\n\nThe flames recede, uncovering my eyes. I see and feel my body glow red-hot but never burn, a magical sheen of fire fused to my skin. All across my field of view, pyres of flame flicker and dance in the shifting eather like trees as elementals of all shapes and sizes play in the fields of lava, ash, and molten sulfur. I have done it. I have reached the plane of Fire!"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.title:0 = "Interrupted Translocation- Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.desc:0 = "My concentration flickers as the elementals we have summoned engulf me in intense flame, and the heat singes my skin. Something has gone wrong! In the depths of my empathic connection with the fire spirits who are here to aid me, my heart resonates as they experience a moment of doubt. Even as their flames lash my pain-stricken body, I overcome physical distress and reach out in reassurance and gratitude towards my infernal friends and feel their concern for me. Although this development is unfavorable, it is no less accounted for in my plans.\n\nIn the split second I have to review my options I decide to..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1005.desc:0 = "My concentration was broken, my skin was badly burned, the spirits seemed to have sensed my weakness and retreated out of concern for my safety. It is clear that something was done incorrectly, or possibly that my connection with the spirits simply was not strong enough. I must overcome this failure and bide my time until conditions are once again right for another attempt to reach the Elemental Plane of Fire."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.title:0 = "The Silence of the Fire Spirits"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.desc:0 = "It seems my arrival on the Plane of Fire has not met with any attention, despite the alienness and dramatic nature of my appearance here. The elemental planes, unlike the world of Azeroth, are amorphous and do not behave accourding to the laws of geometry. It will be impossible to gain an audience with the Firelord unless I have the support of the planar elementals to guide me to their palace. I must find some way to get their attention..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.title:0 = "A Greeting from the Fire Spirits"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.desc:0 = "I am recognized by the planar elementals as a visitor from the terrestrial planes, and the spirits begin to gravitate towards me and circle me curiously. Some even touch me with their flaming appendages, puzzled by my alien, material nature.\n\nEventually, the crowd parts, and a vaguely humanoid elemental strides forth, arms outstretched in a gesture of generosity. In its right hand is a font of mystical energy that seems attracted to my being, sure to augment my power. The other is quite obviously molten gold, a rarity on this plane as it is on our world, that will solidify when I return home.\n\nWith the friendship of the denizens of this sacred realm secured, my safe passage to the Firelord's palace should be assured. Now I must decide whether to accept one of these gifts..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1102.desc:0 = "With a guide secured from amongst my new friends here on the Plane of Fire, I now must choose a route to navigate the plane on my journey to the Firelord's palace. Due to the shifting and non-euclidean nature of the plane, every journey is different and each route may take a different amount of time.\n\nSome of these routes pass across the very borders of the plane, potentially granting me access to a font of elemental energy of purity not normally available on Azeroth.Which should I choose?"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1200.desc:0 = "My long journey through the Firelands has finally led me to the gates of the Firelord's palace. Walls of frozen flame stand strong in imposing columns, vaults and spires. Within, I can sense elemental beings of unfathomable power seething and milling about; and at the center of it all, the imposing energy of the Firelord themself.\n\nThe essence of the terrestrial fire elementals that protects me from harm here resonates with excitement through our empathic bond. With an infernal roar, the gates before me heave open..."
