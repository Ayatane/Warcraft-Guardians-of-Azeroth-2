wc_elemental_ritual_events.1001.title:0 "The Path to the Firelands"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1001.desc:0 "In my many years of communion with the elements, I have heard whispers from the spirits and discerned ancient shamanic carvings regarding a feat of mastery that separates a simple tribal shaman from a truly legendary elementalist who has become one with the domain of Fire...\n\nWith the knowledge I have gathered over years of communion and research I have sketched the outline of a ritual that will transport me to the Elemental Plane of Fire itself. This ritual would be too dangerous for a journeyman ingnimancer, but I am sure that my strong bond with the fire spirits of Azeroth will protect me should I successfully reach the plane of Fire. The end result, an audience with the legendary Firelord, could grant me great power to protect my people and the elemental spirits of this world."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1001.a:0 "Begin the Ritual!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1001.b:0 "I am not ready for this."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1002.title:0 "Translocation Ritual- Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1002.desc:0 "Enchanted braziers crackle in the dark, the scent of ash and brimstone fills the air. My assistant places hot embers at exact points on a sigil etched with charcoal onto the stone floor. My mind is focused as I pass the halfway mark of the complex incantation, my mind focused solely on my objective, reaching the Elemental plane of Fire.\n\nMonths of planning, preparation, and communion with the terrestrial elemental spirits of fire have led to this moment; the journey to the Elemental plane in the hopes of an audience with the Firelord himself. My mastery of elemental fire must be complete, or else I will spontaneously immolate upon arrival from the intense planar heat. This will not come to pass. I am ready."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1003.title:0 "Planar Translocation- Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1003.desc:0 "A surge of heat courses across my body, and for an instant I see my assistant thrown back as I am engulfed in flame. The fire elemental spirits that have gathered around me surge into the inferno and reach their tendrils into my body, touching my essence and making me one of them for a time. I feel their heat, their will, the feelings of friendship and trust we have cultivated on this spiritual journey together. It gathers to a crescendo and suddenly...\n\nThe flames recede, uncovering my eyes. I see and feel my body glow red-hot but never burn, a magical sheen of fire fused to my skin. All across my field of view, pyres of flame flicker and dance in the shifting aether like trees as elementals of all shapes and sizes play in the fields of lava, ash, and molten sulfur. I have done it. I have reached the plane of Fire!"
wc_elements_ignore:0 "The Elements Ignore you."
wc_elements_welcome:0 "The Elements Welcome you."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1003.a:0 "My journey begins now..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.title:0 "Interrupted Translocation- Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.desc:0 "My concentration flickers as the elementals we have summoned engulf me in intense flame, and the heat singes my skin. Something has gone wrong! In the depths of my empathic connection with the fire spirits who are here to aid me, my heart resonates as they experience a moment of doubt. Even as their flames lash my pain-stricken body, I overcome physical distress and reach out in reassurance and gratitude towards my infernal friends and feel their concern for me. Although this development is unfavorable, it is no less accounted for in my plans.\n\nIn the split second I have to review my options I decide to..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.giveup:0 "Give up. My efforts are not working."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.force:0 "Try again, using force to bring myself into the elemental plane."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1004.sac:0 "Sacrifice Power."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1005.title:0 "Planar Fire Ritual Abandoned"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1005.desc:0 "My concentration was broken, my skin was badly burned, the spirits seemed to have sensed my weakness and retreated out of concern for my safety. It is clear that something was done incorrectly, or possibly that my connection with the spirits simply was not strong enough. I must overcome this failure and bide my time until conditions are once again right for another attempt to reach the Elemental Plane of Fire."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1005.a:0 "This is the end..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.title:0 "The Silence of the Fire Spirits"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.desc:0 "It seems my arrival on the Plane of Fire has not met with any attention, despite the alienness and dramatic nature of my appearance here. The elemental planes, unlike the world of Azeroth, are amorphous and do not behave according to the laws of geometry. It will be impossible to gain an audience with the Firelord unless I have the support of the planar elementals to guide me to their palace. I must find some way to get their attention..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.fail:0 "Your attempt to get their attention fails."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.offended:0 "They are offended by your attempt."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.success:0 "Your attempt to get their attention is successful."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.journey:0 "Your Journey in the Firelands continues..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.diplomacy:0 "Surely my charisma is enough."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.magic:0 "I will show them my power!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1100.terr:0 "Summoning a Terrestrial might be my best bet, actually."
wc_elemental_rituals_events.1100.desc_forced:0 "Although I know force is not the best way to proceed, I try my luck with it anyway. I begin to feel an almost painful warmth throughout my body, and realize I have made it into the Plane of Fire!\n\n"
wc_elemental_rituals_events.1100.desc_sac:0 "My power does not rival to that of the Elemental Spirits, but I hope my offering shows them the respect and admiration I have towards them. My skin softly singes as I am surrounded by flame, and in my concentration, I realize I have made it into the Plane of Fire!\n\n"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.title:0 "A Greeting from the Fire Spirits"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.desc:0 "I am recognized by the planar elementals as a visitor from the terrestrial planes, and the spirits begin to gravitate towards me and circle me curiously. Some even touch me with their flaming appendages, puzzled by my alien, material nature.\n\nEventually, the crowd parts, and a vaguely humanoid elemental strides forth, arms outstretched in a gesture of generosity. In its right hand is a font of mystical energy that seems attracted to my being, sure to augment my power. The other is quite obviously molten gold, a rarity on this plane as it is on our world that will solidify when I return home.\n\nWith the friendship of the denizens of this sacred realm secured, my safe passage to the Firelord's palace should be assured. Now I must decide whether to accept one of these gifts..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.magic:0 "Accept the gift of flame."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.magma:0 "Accept the gift of magma."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.magma_gold:0 "The magma solidifies into gold:"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.none:0 "Graciously refuse their gifts."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1101.none_good:0 "The Elements recognize your wisdom"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1110.title:0 "Passage Through the Firelands"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1110.desc:0 "With a guide secured from amongst my new friends here on the Plane of Fire, I now must choose a route to navigate the plane on my journey to the Firelord's palace. Due to the shifting and non-euclidean nature of the plane, every journey is different and each route may take a different amount of time.\n\nSome of these routes pass across the very borders of the plane, potentially granting me access to a font of elemental energy of purity not normally available on Azeroth.Which should I choose?"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1110.air:0 "Journey through the Howling Spires."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1120.title:0 "At the Firelord's Gate"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1120.desc:0 "My long journey through the Firelands has finally led me to the gates of the Firelord's palace. Walls of frozen flame stand strong in imposing columns, vaults and spires. Within, I can sense elemental beings of unfathomable power seething and milling about; and at the center of it all, the imposing energy of the Firelord themself.\n\nThe essence of the terrestrial fire elementals that protects me from harm here resonates with excitement through our empathic bond. With an infernal roar, the gates before me heave open..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1102.wow:0 "...and I'm in awe!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1102.idc:0 "...and I am NOT impressed."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1102.scared:0 "...and I tremble in fear."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1200.title:0 "The Firelord's Palace"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1200.desc:0 "Upon entry to the Firelord's palace, I find myself suddenly protected by a bubble of planar fire magic and the terrestrial elemental that has been protecting me with its essence separates and dashes off ahead of me. Great fonts of fire extend into a mind-boggling branching pattern that disobeys all laws of physics as it branches into multiple worlds and realities; the font of fire elemental power at the center of all worlds.\n\nMy elemental protector returns with one of the Firelord's attendants. I have been recognized for my service and granted an audience with the Firelord, and am welcome to ask for some of this power while I wait."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.title:0 "Audience with the Firelord"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.desc:0 "Finally, the culmination of all my efforts-- an audience with the Firelord themself! Even within my protective bubble, the heat is unbearable as the fire energy from every plane siphons through the great personification of all flame.\n\n"WELCOME, MORTAL, TO MY REALM," the Firelord's voice crackles. "IT IS NOT FREQUENT WE HAVE VISITORS FROM THE MORTAL PLANE. YOUR POWER AND SERVICE TO MY CHILDREN ARE KNOWN TO ME. TELL ME, WHAT IS YOUR REQUEST? I SHALL GRANT ANY DESIRE WITHIN REASON."\n\nNow is the moment I have been waiting for. I request..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.mastery:0 "...mastery over Fire magic."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.peace:0 "...peace in my realm."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.funds:0 "...wealth in the material plane."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.power:0 "...more power in Azeroth."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1210.mean:0 "...the suffering of my Enemies."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.title:0 "The Feast of Fire"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.desc:0 "With my audience with the Firelord complete, I am invited to sit at his table as an esteemed guest. To my surprise, a selection of fire energy shaped like foods from the material plane is presented before me. I am informed that these energies will not only sustain me but grant me magical boons. Looking upon the table, considering all different selections, I think I will have..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.loaf:0 "...some slices of the Magma bread."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.eggnog:0 "...a sip of the inferno-infused eggnog."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.burger:0 "...a bite of the combustible burger?!."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.cake:0 "...a sizeable slice of Ash Cake."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1220.fat:0 "...how about everything?"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.title:0 "Journey's End"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.desc:0 "At last, the time has come to return to Azeroth with my newfound powers and the blessing of the Firelord. The ability to not just speak to the elemental spirits, but to have them speak back, has given me a newfound understanding of their nature which I can bring with me to my shamanic practice at home.\n\nOne of the firelord's priestly attendants offers me a final blessing to vouchsafe my journey home. I choose..."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.terrestrial:0 "The companion terrestrial that has guided me!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.mana:0 "An easier way back."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.mana.tt:0 "The next Planar Fire you cast will cost no mana and have an instant cast time."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1300.lazy:0 "You have given me enough."
wc_free_planar_fire:0 "Blessing from last Planar Fire"
wc_planar_fire_army:0 "Troops from the Firelands"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1310.title:0 "Return to Azeroth"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1310.desc:0 "With an explosion of intense heat, I am returned to the terrestrial plane of Azeroth. The feeling of my body being pulled so suddenly leaves me breathless and numb, and I stumble to the ground. All around me the world feels empty and cold, the transition from constant intense heat and elemental essence to temperate materiality is jarring. The elements of fire feel distant and all feels silent.\n\nAfter a few moments I get my bearings and return to my feet. My assistant is gone, and it is likely I have been away for months in real time. With my newfound power and the blessings of the elemental plane of fire, there is much to be done."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1310.a:0 "And so it ends..."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1501.title:0 "New Worlds to Conquer"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1501.desc:0 "As I have matured in my shamanistic abilities, it has become clear to me that the elemental powers I wield have a source beyond our world. The elementals of Azeroth are strong, but nowhere near as powerful as those on the Elemental plane which is the source of all Fire energy. The obvious conclusion is that we must open a path to this plane and subjugate its inhabitants as we have the elementals of this world, to increase our power and cement our control over this world. After years of research and careful planning, my plans may finally have come to fruition. Is it time to invade the Firelands?"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1501.a:0 "Prepare the Portal!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1501.b:0 "I am not ready for this."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1502.title:0 "Opening the Way"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1502.desc:0 "All the preparations are complete. My most powerful fire elemental servants will expend their energy, sacrificed to burn a hole through the Twisting Nether straight into the heart of the Firelands from which they draw power. My own personal elemental slave will transform themself into a shield for my physical form as I lead the remainder of my elemental janissaries and shaman warriors into the firelands.\n\nHere we shall establish a beachhead from which we will extract the power of the Firelands directly. From there, we shall march on the very palace of the Firelord, lay it to siege, and force him to accept our colonial rights in his realm. With a blast of heat, the first elementals blink into nothingness and the portal begins to grow. Soon my destiny will be achieved!"

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1503.title:0 "The Failing Portal"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1503.desc:0 "Suddenly, one of the elementals channeling energy into the nascent portal explodes, erasing carefully drawn ritual lines. A chain reaction occurs as feedback enates from the portal, and energy arcs from one elemental to the next, annihilating my expendable servants by the dozen.\n\nIf this continues, I could lose everything I have worked for! I must act, and quickly, in order to secure the growing portal and vouchsafe my invasion to the firelands."
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1503.a:0 "This may make things harder, but I must push on!"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1503.b:0 "I give up."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1505.title:0 "Firelands Invasion Scrubbed"
wc_elemental_ritual_events.1505.desc:0 "My plans to invade, colonize, and exploit the Firelands and their vast elemental wealth have been scuttled. I did not make this decision lightly. Of course this is not the end of my designs on the Elemental plane. I will regroup, gather resources once more, and make another attempt when the time is right."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1600.desc:0 "With a rush of flame, I step through the portal into the firelands. All across my field of view, pyres of flame flicker and dance in the shifting aether like trees as elementals of all shapes and sizes mill about in the fields of lava, ash, and molten sulfur. It is all I imagined and more.\n\nNow, my subordinate shamans and elemental slave-troops surge through the portal and immediately begin sculpting the solidified inferno of the land into fortifications and energy extractors to funnel its sheer energetic power home to Azeroth. But there is no time to spare. The elementals here must be subjugated, and the Firelord brought to heel.."

wc_elemental_ritual_events.1601.desc:0 "Now that our position is secure, we can expand our operations in the region. Now that the elementals and fire energy of the region are being processed, it has become apparent that not all the slaves and resources here are usable in the material world. Some are too weak, and would simply vanish as soon as they left the plane. Others are too strong, and would explode violently before they could be put to use. \n\n One suggestion is to use them to augment our forces here on the elemental plane. Another is to use them to empower myself and my shamans while we are here. I have decided to…"

Due to the shifting and non-euclidean nature of the plane, every path is different and each route may take a different amount of time.\n\nSome of the possible campaigns pass along the very borders of the plane, potentially granting me access to a font of elemental energy of purity not normally available on Azeroth.
