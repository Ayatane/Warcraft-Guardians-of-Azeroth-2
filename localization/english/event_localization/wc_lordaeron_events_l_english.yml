### Terenas Funeral
 lordaeron.2001.t:0 "Death of our King"
 lordaeron.2001.d:0 "A somber atmosphere envelops Lordaeron as [terenas.GetNamePossessive] funeral pyre is lit.\n\nMany begin to gather around the scene, whispering among themselves about the fallen. As the plague begins to spread rapidly, this could be one of many funerals to come. A grim silence is felt as we watch [terenas.GetNamePossessive] body begin to burn. The fire dances and swirls, casting an orange glow that reflects in the tearful eyes of those gathered. As the intensity of the blaze grows, a plume of smoke rises skyward, carrying with it the remnants of the departed.\n\nTo be slain by your own kin, your bloodline, is a fate none wish to match. Each crackle of the bonfire represents a step he took — a problem he faced — in helping us to thrive in this great country of ours. Even in our darkest days, in this current plague, he had never faltered. The loss of this Kingdom's fierce leader, as well as the crimes of his killer, may never be forgotten."
