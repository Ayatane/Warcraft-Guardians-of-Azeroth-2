magic_secret.0001.desc.light:0 "It came to me in a moment of inspiration, a voice from beyond; a call to a higher cause. Something outside our world has found me worthy, virtuous, and strong enough to work the miracles of Light on Azeroth. I can feel its power coursing through me, like a a swelling of song that never ends. The wounded bird which lays below me in the bush, a sweet and fragile creature brought low by nature's roil, suddenly begins to stir as its little wing ceases to bleed and rights itself into position as if time itself is rewound. Tears of joy and gratitude pour from my eyes. \nYet as compelled as I am to use this power to heal the sick and convict the wicked, society does not agree. This light growing within me shall remain hidden for now; until the blind are made to see."
magic_secret.0001.desc.shadow:0 "I call out mentally to the Void, a place beyond all life and rational thought, as I have a hundred thousand times before. I reach out my hand towards the small rat scurrying back and forth in its cage, willing its frantic motion to cease. Suddenly, I feel as if my heart has been pulled from my chest and the heat removed from my body. All is silent, my mind is clear, and the rat is frozen in a standing position, unnaturally slumped. I release my grip on its mind, and allow a smile to cross my face. \nMany months, even years of effort, have led to this moment; but I must remain vigilant. The forces with which I have made contact are poorly understood by those around me. I must use this power with care, keeping their eyes closed to what they cannot fathom."
magic_secret.0001.desc.life:0 "It happened all at once; the most shocking thing I have ever seen was not the aftermath of a great battle or the luck of a parlour game's winnings. It occurred right here, in this garden, beneath my folded hands... A row of withered melon vines suddenly swelled with green life , flowered, and bore fruit in the blink of an eye. All around me, birds called, insects buzzed, the scurry of a field mouse could be heard. I reach out with my mind to call to them and I hear them all as plain as day. The magic I have sought for so long, the essence of life so shunned by my people, has lent me its aid to heal the land that my fellows have broken and burned. From now on I must tread carefully, lest their cruel gazes turn upon me and I become spurned in the eyes of all I know and love."
magic_secret.0001.desc.death:0 "I break the neck of my last living squirrel, place it on the blood-spattered runes I have prepared, and say the incantation once more. Then I wait and... Nothing. Blast and drat! This wretched book, will it ever reveal its secrets to me? Carelessly and full of frustration, I cast the limpid rodent upon the heap of rotting corpses piled against the basement wall and turn to leave. But as I take a step toward the stairs, I hear a crack and a squalid creak, like air escaping a cask of wine. I turn around and to my shock and joy the squirrel stands atop the corpse-pile, head hanging limp as an empty sack. Finally! I have done it! Now I can turn my attention to bigger things... \nBut no, I must be cautious. These fools around me will never understand the power I wield over the dead! They will hate me, persecute me, take my property, humiliate me... I must remain in the shadows until I am strong enough to show them all what true fear means."
magic_secret.0001.desc.order:0 "\"Yes, yes, yes... Yes! YES! No! NO! NONONONONONONO!\" \nA cascade of Arcane energy crackles forth from the rift I have just created, its purple beams scour my body and shake my atelier, casting my precise instruments and precious books into a storm of disarray. In only a moment I muster my resolve and recite the incantation I memorized for exactly this eventuality; if only I had not been lost at this momentous acheivement all this mess could have been avoided! Still, as the portal closes, I allow myself another well-deserved shout of exultation. \nIn the ensuing silence, I ponder that it may be my last. If anyone saw what happened here... Why, the fools, they'd never understand! True knowledge, the science of the astral energies, is banned in this dismal land where I reside. If I am to continue my studies from safely outside the pillory, there shall be no more loud cries from here on out! \nYes, only careful and silent study going forward... Now, what does this formula mean?"
magic_secret.0001.desc.disorder:0 "As I mutter the last words of the fel incantation I have been studying, the runic circle inscribed on my attic floor begins to glow with a blinding, sickly green light. With it, my heart swells and I am unable to contain my delight, cackling with glee as the air fills with the scent of spent gunpowder. I close the book of incantations with a flourish as the light dims. \"Demon!\" I shout, \"You serve...\" my sentence drops off as my eyes search for my new charge... Where is he? I can feel him near... My eyes drift down to the floor where, covered in slime, a small wormlike creature with a lamprey-maw squeals and purrs in a sickening tone.\nIn a rage, I smash the pitiful creature beneath my bootheel. Its remains are sticky and caustic, they reek of sulfur and rotten meat. \nThis is what I have so endangered myself for? Is this their \"crime\" of demonology? No, no, the fools have outlawed this power for a reason. This is only the first step, and with appropriate caution I shall soon be secretly summoning creatures of such power, wielding forces of such destructive vim that they will all bow before me and beg to lick this slime from my dissolving sole!"
