magic_lifestyle.0001.desc:0 "My call for a court mage has resulted in promising results, and now the candidates stand before me. One is a learned individual who provides a full accounting of their skills, an impressive pedigree that my councillors assure me will make them a useful asset to the court. The other is a more cagey type, quick of wit, who seems to know more than they are willing to let on. While a riskier choice, it may open the door to certain... forbidden abilities... that might prove useful to me. Or perhaps they are simply a more private person?"

Traditionally, my people selects a scholar from the Magocracy of Dalaran to serve as court mage, and doing so will certainly increase my standing amongst my peers. The mage that has been sent by the Kirin Tor is truly impressive, an individual of dignity and power.\n\nIn addition, there is a locally trained hedge wizard who provides a full accounting of their skills, an impressive pedigree that a useful and less expensive if slightly less traditional asset to the court. Finally, at the end of the pack stands a more cagey type, quick of wit, who seems to know more than they are willing to let on. While a riskier choice, it may open the door to certain... forbidden abilities... that might prove useful to me. Or perhaps they are simply a more private person?"
magic_lifestyle.0002.opt.a:0 "To choose the mage from Dalaran is most wise."
magic_lifestyle.0002.opt.b:0 "I will take my chances with the hedge wizard."
magic_lifestyle.0002.opt.c:0 "You over there in the corner! Step forward..."
